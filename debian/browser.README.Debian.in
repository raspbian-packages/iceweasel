@Browser@ for Debian
====================

Please read the file /usr/share/bug/@browser@/presubj for information
you may want to know if you will report a bug.

Why is it not called Firefox?
-----------------------------

The Firefox logo used to be distributed under a non-free copyright
license. The Mozilla Corporation insisted that we not use the trademarked
name Firefox with the "unofficial" logo (a globe without the firefox).
Most of the details are documented in #354622
<http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=354622>.

In the meanwhile, the Firefox logo was released under a free copyright
license, but a trademark policy is in place to limit the use of the
Firefox branding. Until trademark licensing terms are sorted out,
the Iceweasel name stays.

Even though it is not called Firefox, it still comes from exactly the
same upstream, and is by and large exactly the same (the differences
include some distribution specific customizations, rebranding and the
occasional bug fix).

Sound
-----

@Browser@ used to provide a facility to setup a dsp wrapper for sound
support. The main contender that required this is the proprietary Flash
plugin, which has supported ALSA for a while now.

However, if for some reason Flash gets it wrong and uses OSS instead, you
can set the FLASH_ALSA_DEVICE variable to tell it what ALSA device it can
use.

using Java. (You should use plugin which compiled with gcc-3.2 or newer)
----------
 
You can install one of the following packages: 
 - gcjwebplugin,
 - java-gcj-compat-plugin,
 - sun-java5-plugin.

Alternatively, you can grab a binary Java distribution from
http://java.sun.com/, install the java-package package and do a make-jpkg
on the file.

Buttons
-------

Some people have complained that the button order in dialogs is
non-intuitive (ie, they don't like it). To reverse the order, add the
following to your chrome/userChrome.css file, under the
~/.mozilla/firefox directory:

.dialog-button-box { -moz-box-direction: reverse; -moz-box-pack: right; }
.dialog-button-box spacer { display: none ! important; }

Emacs keybindings
-----------------

Versions of Firefox before 1.0 supported Emacs style keybindings in
text entry boxes. Version 1.0 now merely follows the GTK keybindings
settings. To enable Emacs keybindings in GTK, follow the instructions
at http://kb.mozillazine.org/Emacs_Keybindings_(Firefox).

Well Known Ports
----------------

To prevent @Browser@ from being used to launch attacks against other
protocols, certain ports cannot be connected to by default. See
http://www.mozilla.org/projects/netlib/PortBanning.html for further
information. To allow the port numbers being used, enter
"about:config" in the URL bar and edit the
"network.security.ports.banned.override" entry to list the ports you
wish to allow (eg "2049,4045,6000").

Safe Browsing
-------------

Phishing and malware protection, also known as Safe Browsing, makes use
of a third party web service and regularly downloads updates. More
information on how this works and what is being sent and downloaded are
available on the following page:
