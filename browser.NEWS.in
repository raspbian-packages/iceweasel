iceweasel (31.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Since version 30.0, NTLMv1 authentication has been disabled because
    it's known as insecure. Companies and organizations still deploying
    the older protocol should upgrade to NTLMv2, unfortunately, it's not
    supported by iceweasel.
    It is however still possible to toggle the preference to continue using
    NTLMv1, though the NTLM auth support is considered deprecated, by
    switching the network.negotiate-auth.allow-insecure-ntlm-v1 preference
    in about:config.

    for more details.
