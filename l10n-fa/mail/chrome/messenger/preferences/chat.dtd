<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE: reportIdleAfter.label is displayed first, then
there's a field where the user can enter a number, and itemTime is
displayed at the end of the line. The translations of the
reportIdleAfter.label and idleTime parts don't have to mean the exact
same thing as in English; please try instead to translate the whole
sentence. -->
