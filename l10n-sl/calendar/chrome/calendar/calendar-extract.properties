# LOCALIZATION NOTE:
# Strings here are used to create events and tasks with start and end times
# based on email content.
# None of the strings are displayed in the user interface.
#
# You don't have to fill all from.*, until.*, *.prefix and *.suffix patterns.
# It's ok to leave some empty.
# Please consider declensions and gender if your language has them.
# Don't just translate directly. The number of variants doesn't have to be
# the same as in en-US. All of 0, 1, 2, etc is allowed in patterns except alphabet
# pattern. You can and should add language specific variants.
#
# There are two different ways to find a start time text in email:
# 1) it matches a from.* pattern and does not have end.prefix or end.suffix next to it
# 2) it matches until.* pattern and has start.prefix or start.suffix next to it
# Similar inverse logic applies to end times.
# These rules enable using prefix and suffix values with only start.* or only until.*
# patterns localized for some languages and thus not having to repeat the same
# values in both.
#
# Patterns are partially space-insensitive.
# "deadline is" pattern will find both "deadlineis" and "deadline  is"
# but "deadlineis" won't find "deadline is" or "deadline  is".
# Therefore you should include all spaces that are valid within a pattern.
